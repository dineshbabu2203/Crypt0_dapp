This project is a modern Web3.0 decentralized application (dApp) that demonstrates
how users can seamlessly interact with blockchain technology through a user-friendly web interface. 
Built with React (Vite) for the frontend and styled using Tailwind CSS, the application connects
to the Ethereum blockchain using MetaMask for wallet management and either Ethers.js or Web3.js for smart contract interaction. 
The primary goal of this dApp is to showcase the decentralized transaction flow, allowing users to initiate
and view blockchain operations without relying on a centralized backend.

The frontend is lightweight, responsive, and optimized for performance using Vite, making development and production builds incredibly fast. 
It includes animated visuals, wallet connection prompts, and a smooth onboarding experience for users unfamiliar with Web3.
Once connected, users can interact with smart contracts (e.g., sending a message, performing a transaction, etc.) 
deployed on the Ethereum test network, with all interactions requiring confirmation via MetaMask. 
This reinforces the principle of user-owned identity and control over blockchain interactions.

Web3 Wallet Integration: MetaMask-based authentication and transaction signing.

Smart Contract Interaction: Directly communicates with deployed smart contracts (assumed on Sepolia or other testnets).

Decentralized Design: All blockchain interactions occur without centralized servers.

Frontend with Vite + React: High performance and modular UI built with Tailwind CSS.

Clean Project Structure: Organized into client (frontend), with placeholders for smart contracts and scripts.

Custom Assets: Includes custom SVGs and images for enhanced user experience.

Developer Friendly: Ready to extend with additional smart contracts, backend APIs, or NFT/token integrations.
